Demo 4: Custom Python Extracts
-----------------------------------

* cloverleaf3d: custom python histogram

Ascent's python extract provides a simple path to run python scripts for
custom analysis. For this demo we use numpy and mpi4py to compute a histogram of Cloverleaf's 
energy field. 

First, since we will use the Cloverleaf3d Ascent integration, make sure you are in 
``examples/proxies/cloverleaf3d`` directory of your Ascent install. Then edit the ``ascent_actions.json`` 
file to define a single python extract that runs a script file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/examples/tutorial/demo_4/ascent_actions.json
   :language: json

This requests a python extract that will use an embedded python interpreter to execute 
``ascent_tutorial_demo_4_histogram.py``, which is specified using the ``file`` parameter.
The python extract also supports a ``source`` parameter that allows you to pass 
a python script as a string. 


Next, create our analysis script ``ascent_tutorial_demo_4_histogram.py``:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/examples/tutorial/demo_4/ascent_tutorial_demo_4_histogram.py 
   :language: python
   :lines: 43-

This script computes a basic histogram counting the number of energy field elements that
fall into a set of uniform bins.  It uses numpy's histogram function and mpi4py to handle 
distributed-memory coordination. 

Note, there are only two functions provided by ascent:

* ``ascent_data()``
 
   Returns a Conduit tree with the data published to this MPI Task. 

   Conduit's Python API mirrors its C++ API, but with leaves returned as numpy.ndarrays.
   For examples of how to use Conduit's Python API, see the 
   `Conduit Python Tutorial <http://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_python.html>`_.
   In this script, we simply fetch a ndarray that points to the values of a known field, energy. 
   

* ``ascent_mpi_comm_id()``

   Returns the Fortran style MPI handle (an integer) of the MPI Communicator Ascent is using.

   In this script, we use this handle and ``mpi4py.MPI.Comm.f2py()`` to obtain a mpi4py 
   Communicator.



Finally, run Cloverleaf:

.. code::

   mpiexec -n 2 ./cloverleaf3d_par 


With the default ``clover.in`` settings, Ascent execute the python script every 10th cycle. 
The script computes the histogram of the energy field and prints a summary like the following: 

.. code::

  Energy extents: 1.0 2.93874088025
