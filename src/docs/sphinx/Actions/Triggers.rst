Triggers
========
Triggers allow the user to specify a set of actions that are `triggered` by
the result of a boolean expression. Triggers leverage the query and expression
system to enable a set of primitives to create custom tailored triggers for
simulations. There are several motivations that make triggers useful.
Examples include cost reduction (time) and debugging (correctness).

Cost Reduction
--------------
Visualization and analysis operation are not free, i.e., performing them takes time.
One example is that rendering an image every simulation cycle might be a relatively high cost.
Another example is performing a potentially time consuming operation like flow field analysis
may might need to take place at a lower frequency than each time ``ascent.execute(actions)`` is
called or may need to execute only when a specific simulation event occurs.

Debugging
---------
Triggers can be a useful tool in detecting anomalous conditions while a simulation is
running. For example, triggers can detect of the minimum or maximum values of a field
are outside the expected ranges and dump out the mesh and related field for inspection
inside of VisIt.

Simple Example
--------------
A trigger requires a trigger condition and a actions file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_triggers"
       triggers:
         t1:
           params:
             condition: "cycle() % 100 == 0"
             actions_file : "my_trigger_actions.yaml"


In this example, the trigger will fire when the current cycle is divisible by 100.

Queries and Triggers
--------------------
Triggers can leverage the query system, and combining both queries and triggers
creates a rich set of potential options for triggers.


Debugging
^^^^^^^^^
The following code example shows how queries and triggers can be used for debugging:

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             # get the maximum value of a field
             expression: "max(field('pressure'))"
             name: "max_pressure"
         q2:
           params:
             expression: "1e300"
             name: "crazy_value"
     -
       action: "add_triggers"
       triggers:
         t1:
           params:
             condition: "max_pressure > crazy_value"
             actions_file : "my_trigger_actions.yaml"

In the above example, the trigger will fire if the maximum value of pressure exceeds ``crazy_value``.
A useful actions file might dump the mesh to a hdf5 file for later inspection.

Event Detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following code example shows how queries and triggers can be used for to detect a jump in
entropy that could represent a simulation event that the user wants act on:

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             expression: "entropy(histogram(field('pressure'))"
             name: "entropy"
     -
       action: "add_triggers"
       triggers:
         t1:
           params:
             condition: "history(entropy, relative_index = 1) - entropy > 10"
             actions_file : "my_trigger_actions.yaml"

In the above example, the trigger will fire if the change in entropy changes by more than
10 in positive direction.
