Queries
========
Queries are a way to ask questions and get anwsers.
Each query has to required parameters: an expression and a name.

Below is an example of a simple query.

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             expression: "cycle()"
             name: "my_cycle"

.. note::
    Queries currently only support inspecting the data published to Ascent, and queries
    on the results of pipelines is **not** currently supported..


The results of queries can be accessed by the simulation and serve as a way to compose
complex triggers, i.e., taking actions as a result of a condition.
Query support is in beta, meaning its a part of Ascent currently under development.

Expressions Overview
--------------------
Expressions are based on a simple python-like language that supports math evaluation and function calls.

Basic Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are three main intergal types in the language:

   - integers
   - floating point
   - boolean
   - strings

Operators
^^^^^^^^^
The supported math operators follow the standard operator precedence order:

   - ``()``: grouping
   - ``f(args...)``: function call
   - ``a.attribute``: attribute reference
   - ``-``: negation
   - ``*, /, %``: multiplicatoin, division, modulus (remainder)
   - ``+, -``: addition, subtraction
   - ``not, or, and, <, <=, >, >=, !=, ==``: comparisons

Control Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The expression language currently supports simple if-then-else semantics.

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             expression: "if cycle() > 100 then 1 else 0"
             name: "cycle_bigger_than_100"

.. note::
   Both branches of the if-then-else will be execute.

Functions
^^^^^^^^^
The expression system supports functions both required and optional (named) parameters.
Functions can both accept and return complex objects like histograms or arrays.
Additionally, function overloading is supported and the overload type is resolved by the
function parameters.


Functioj Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - ``cycle()``: returns the current simulation cycle
   - ``field("braid")``: returns a field object for the simulation field specified
   - ``histogram(field("braid"), num_bins=128)``: returns a historgram of the ``braid`` field
   - ``entropy(histogram(field("braid"), num_bins=128))``: returns a the entopy of the historgram of the ``braid`` field

The Name
--------
The result of the expression is `stored` internally and can be accessed in two ways.

 - Through the ``ascent.Info(info_node)`` call. This can be used as a way to feed information back the simulation.
 - As an identifier in a subsequent expression.

Combining Queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Queries are executed in the same order they are declared, and since the result of each query stored,
each query can be thought of as an assignement statement in a program, with one query building on the previous queries.

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             expression: "1+1"
             name: "two"
         q2:
           params:
             expression: "two + 1"
             name: "result"

In the above example, ``q1`` is evaluated and the result is stored in the identifier ``two``.
In ``q2``, the identifier is referenced and the expression evaluates to ``3``.

Query History
-------------
Since the results of queries are stored, we can access values from previous executions.
The history function allows expressions to have a temporal component, which is a powerful tool
when tracking simulation state and adaptively responding to user defined events.
The history function can be called on any existing query.

The history of a query can be indexed in two ways:

   - ``relative_index``: a positive value that indicates how far back in history to access. If the index exceeds the current history, the value is clamped to the last index. An index of 0 is equivelent to the current time value and and index of 1 is the value of the identifier on the last execution.
   - ``absolue_index``: the index of the value to access. 0 is the first query result.

Here is an example of a use case for the history function:

.. code-block:: yaml

   actions:
     -
       action: "add_queries"
       queries:
         q1:
           params:
             # get the maximum value of a field
             expression: "max(field("pressure"))"
             name: "max_pressure"
         q2:
           params:
             expression: "max_pressure > history(max_pressure, relative_index = 1) + 100"
             name: "result"

In the above example, `q2` will evaluate to true if the maximum value of pressure jumps over 100 units
since the last in invocation, possibly indicating that an interesting event inside the simulation occured.
