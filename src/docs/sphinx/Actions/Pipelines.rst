Pipelines
=========
Pipelines allow users to compose filters that transform the published input data into new meshes.
This is where users specify typical geometric transforms (e.g., clipping and slicing), field based transforms (e.g., threshold and contour), etc. 
The resulting data from each Pipeline can be used as input to Scenes or Extracts. 
Each pipeline contains one or more filters that transform the published mesh data.
When more than one filter is specified, each successive filter consumes the result of the previous filter, and filters are executed in the order in which they are declared.

The code below shows the declaration of two pipelines. 
The first applies a contour filter to extract two isosurfaces of the scalar field ``noise``. 
The second pipeline applies a threshold filter to screen the ``noise`` field, and then a clip filter to extract the intersection of what remains from the threshold with a sphere.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter parameters 
  conduit::Node contour_params; 
  contour_params["field"] = "noise";
  contour_params["iso_values"] = {0.0, 0.5};
  pipelines["pl1/f1/params"] = contour_params;

  // pipeline 2 
  pipelines["pl2/f1/type"] = "threshold";
  // filter parameters
  conduit::Node thresh_params;
  thresh_params["field"]  = "noise";
  thresh_params["min_value"] = 0.0;
  thresh_params["max_value"] = 0.5;
  pipelines["pl2/f1/params"] = thresh_params;

  pipelines["pl2/f2/type"]   = "clip";
  // filter parameters
  conduit::Node clip_params; 
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["sphere/center/x"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/center/y"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/center/z"] = 0.0;
  clip_params["sphere/radius"]   = .1;
  pipelines["pl2/f2/params/"] = clip_params;

Ascent and VTK-h are under heavy development and features are being added rapidly. 
As we stand up the infrastructure necessary to support a wide variety filter we created the following filters for the alpha release:

  - Contour
  - Threshold
  - Slice
  - Three Slice 
  - Clip 

Filters
-------
Our filter API consists of the type of filter and the parameters associated with the filter in the general form:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "type"   : "filter_name",
    "params": 
    {
      "string_param" : "string",
      "double_param" : 2.0
    }
  }

In c++, the equivalent declarations would be as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node filter;
  filter["type"] = "filter_name";
  filter["params/string_param"] = "string";
  filter["params/double_param"] = 2.0;

Included Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contour
~~~~~~~
The contour filter evaluates a node-centered scalar field for all points at a given iso-value.
This results in a surface if the iso-value is within the scalar field. 
``iso_vals`` can contain a single double or an array of doubles. 
The code below provides examples creating a pipeline using both methods:

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &contour_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  contour_params["field"] = "braid";
  contour_params["iso_values"] = -0.4;

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "contour";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &contour_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  contour_params["field"] = "braid";
  double iso_vals[3] = {-0.4, 0.2, 0.4};
  contour_params["iso_values"].set_external(iso_vals,3);

.. _contourfig:

..  figure:: ../images/contour.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of multiple contours produced using the previous code sample.
    
:numref:`Figure %s <contourfig>` shows an image produced from mulitple contours. 
The full example is located in the `test_multi_contour_3d`  test in the file `contour test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_contour.cpp>`_.

Threshold
~~~~~~~~~
The threshold filter removes cells that are not contained within a specified scalar range.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "threshold";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &thresh_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  thresh_params["field"] = "braid";
  thresh_params["min_value"] = -0.2;
  thresh_params["max_value"] = 0.2;

.. _thresholdfig:

..  figure:: ../images/threshold.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of the threshold filter using the previous code sample.

:numref:`Figure %s <thresholdfig>` shows an image produced from a threshold filter. 
The full example is located in the file `threshold test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_threshold.cpp>`_.

Slice
~~~~~
The slice filter extracts a 2d plane from a 3d data set. 
The plane is defined by a point (on the plane) and a normal vector (not required to be nomalized).

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "slice";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &slice_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  slice_params["point/x"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["point/y"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["point/z"] = 0.f;

  slice_params["normal/x"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["normal/y"] = 0.f;
  slice_params["normal/z"] = 1.f;
  
.. _slicefig:

..  figure:: ../images/slice.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of the slice filter on a zone-centered variable using the previous code sample. 

:numref:`Figure %s <slicefig>` shows an image produced from the slice filter. 
The full example is located in the file `slice test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_slice.cpp>`_.

Three Slice
~~~~~~~~~~~
The three slice filter slices 3d data sets using three axis-aligned slice planes and 
leaves the resulting planes in 3d where they can all be viewed at the same time.
Three slice is meant primarily for quick visual exploration of 3D data where the 
internal features cannot be readily observed from the outside. 

The slice planes will automatically placed at the center of the data sets spatial extents. 
Optionally, offsets for each plane can be specified. Offsets for each axis are specified 
by a floating point value in the range ``[-1.0, 1.0]``, where ``-1.0`` places the plane at the
minimum spatial extent on the axis, ``1.0`` places the plane at the maximum spatial extent
on the axis, and ``0.0`` places the plane at the center of the spatial extent. By default,
all three offsets are ``0.0``.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "3slice";
  
.. _threeslicefig:

..  figure:: ../images/three_slice.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of the three slice filter on a zone-centered variable using the 
    previous code sample with automatic slice plane placement. 

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "3slice";
  
  // filter knobs (all these are optional)
  conduit::Node &slice_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  slice_params["x_offset"] = 1.f;   // largest value on the x-axis
  slice_params["y_offset"] = 0.f;   // middle of the y-axis
  slice_params["z_offset"] = -1.f;  // smalles value of the z-axis

.. _threeslice2fig:

..  figure:: ../images/three_slice2.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of the three slice filter on a zone-centered variable using the 
    previous code sample with user specified offsets for each axis. 

:numref:`Figures %s <threeslicefig>` and :numref:`%s <threeslice2fig>` show an images produced from the three slice filter. 
The full example is located in the file `slice test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_slice.cpp>`_.

Clip
~~~~
The clip filter removes cells from the specified topology using implicit functions. 
Only the area outside of the implicit function remains.

.. code-block:: c++

  conduit::Node pipelines;
  // pipeline 1
  pipelines["pl1/f1/type"] = "clip";
  // filter knobs
  conduit::Node &clip_params = pipelines["pl1/f1/params"];
  clip_params["topology"] = "mesh";
  clip_params["sphere/radius"] = 11.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/x"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/y"] = 0.;
  clip_params["sphere/center/z"] = 0.;
  
.. _clipfig:

..  figure:: ../images/clip.png
    :scale: 50 % 
    :align: center

    An example image of the clip filter using the previous code sample. 
    The data set is a cube with extents from (-10, -10, -10) to (10, 10, 10), and the code removes a sphere centered at the origin with a radius of 11.

:numref:`Figure %s <clipfig>` shows an image produced from the clip filter. 
The full example is located in the file `clip test <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/blob/develop/src/tests/ascent/t_ascent_clip.cpp>`_.
