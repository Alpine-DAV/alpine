Tutorial Setup
=================

The tutorial examples are installed with Ascent to the subdirectory ``examples/ascent/tutorial/``.  Below are several options for using pre-built Ascent installs and links to info about building Ascent. If you have access to Docker, the easiest way to test the waters is via the ``alpinedav/ascent`` Docker image.

SC19 Tutorial Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For SC19, we plan to have several instances of our Ascent Docker iamge up and running the jupyter notebook server.
We will provide IP addresses and login info to attendees.

Using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have Docker installed you can obtain a Docker image with a ready-to-use ascent install from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/alpinedav/ascent/>`_. This image also includes a jupyter install to support running Ascent's tutorial notebooks.

Fetch the latest Ascent image:

.. code::

    docker pull alpinedav/ascent

After the download completes, create and run a container using this image:

.. code::

    docker run -p 8000:8000 run -p 8888:8888 -p 10000:10000 -t -i alpinedav/ascent

(The ``-p`` is used to forward ports between the container and your host machine, we use these ports to allow web servers on the container to serve data to the host.)


You will now be at a bash prompt in you container.

To add the proper paths to Python and MPI to your environment run:

.. code::

    source ascent_docker_setup_env.sh

The ascent source code is at ``/home/user/ascent/src/``, and the install is at ``/home/user/ascent/install-debug/``.
The tutorial examples are at ``/home/user/ascent/install-debug/examples/ascent/tutorial/`` and the tutorial notebooks are at ``/home/user/ascent/install-debug/examples/ascent/tutorial/ascent_intro/notebooks/``.


To launch the a jupyter notebook server run:

.. code::

    ./ascent_docker_run_jupyter.sh

This will launch a notebook server on port 8888. Assuming you forwarded port 8888 from the Docker container to your host machine, you should be able to connect to the notebook server using http://localhost:8888. The current password for the notebook server is: ``ascentsc19``


NERSC Cori Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a public ascent install for use on NERSC's Cori System. This install was built with the default
intel compiler (18.0.1.163).

The install is located at ``/project/projectdirs/alpine/software/ascent/current/cori/ascent-install``.
You can copy the tutorial examples from this install and build them as follows:

.. code::

    mkdir ascent_tutorail
    cd ascent_tutorial
    cp -r /project/projectdirs/alpine/software/ascent/current/cori/ascent-install/examples/ascent/tutorial/* .
    cd ascent_intro/cpp
    make ASCENT_DIR=project/projectdirs/alpine/software/ascent/current/cori/ascent-install/


Build and Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build and install Ascent yourself see :doc:`QuickStart`.
